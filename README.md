TESTING

Testing information is in the project-docs folder. 

The contact form could only be tested based on present or missing required fields as no code sits behind the send button. All links were tested and the HTML and CSS were run through W3C validators.

A sample of what has been tested : 
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Responsive behaviour - all pages tested and elements within e.g. table, videos. Breakpoints checked</li>
<li>Browser compatibility - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari tested</li>
<li>Links - check that all links work - header, footer, navigation bar and page content</li>
<li>Navigation bar<li> - check that active page is identifiable & that the hover action works.</li> </li>
</ul>
