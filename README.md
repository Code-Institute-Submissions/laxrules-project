LAXRULES
=========

LAXRULES provides online information to new and existing lacrosse officials. The site is primarily targeting members of Lacrosse Scotland who need to know how to become an official, the courses and testing opportunities available and how to book them. Useful information relating to officiating mechanics is also available to anyone and is available in different formats including videos (courtesy of US Lacrosse). 

A Contact Us form is availble for users to ask questions, which will contribute to the development of a FAQ page.
