                       <p>FIL Rules will be used with the following modification:</p>
                        <h2> FIL RULE 1 Field Markings</h2>
                            <p>A pitch the size of a netball court or 4 badminton courts is ideal. As there is no fan area, umpires need to be extra-vigilant that people do not obstruct the area in front of goal. As the boundaries are fixed (walls), few markings are needed - only a centre spot or "x".</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">               
                        <h2> FIL RULE 2 Goals</h2>
                            <p>A hoop at either end of the hall, securely fixed at a height of 6ft, on a pole, 3-5m from the back wall.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">              
                        <h2> FIL RULE 3 Crosse</h2>
                            <p>No change.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 4 Ball</h2>
                            <p class="red">Please note that, for safety reasons, the no-bounce indoor ball must not be used. The normal outdoor ball should be used. </p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 5 Teams</h2>
                            <p>The maximum roster is 8 people i.e. 3 substitutes plus a maximum 5 players on the pitch at the same</p>
                            <p>If the indoor / 5 a-side team is a mixed (women & men) team – a maximum of 2 men is allowed on the pitch at the same time. This means a minimum of 3 women must be playing at any one time.</p>
                            <p>There are no goalkeepers. Players guarding the goal will be penalised – major foul.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">               
                        <h2> FIL RULE 10 Duration of play</h2>
                            <p>Any tournament can determine a different tournament game length – this is part of the tournament organisational rules. Game length, running clock, time outs, half time can be determined for each tournament and details will be provided separately for each event.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">                   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 11 Substitution</h2>
                            <p>Substitution may be made only when a goal has been scored and play is going back to the centre. There will be a marked sub gate through which players must enter the pitch, unless teams wait outside the games hall, in which case there is no need for a sub date as the players will exit and enter through the door. As the substitution takes place after a goal the substituting player does not have to wait for the exiting player to leave the pitch. Umpires should check that the correct number of players are on the pitch before re-starting play after substitutions have taken place.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">                   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 12 Start & Restart the Game</h2>
                            <p>The game starts with alternate passes from the centre. The player, at the centre, with the ball must pass to another player whilst keeping at least one foot on the ground (i.e. must not move from the centre spot). All other players must be at least 3m away.</p>
                            <p>All play is started and stopped by the whistle. Players must stand on the whistle .</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">                   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 13 Scoring</h2>
                            <p>A goal is scored by shooting a ball into the goal (hoop on a pole). Scoring must be by an attacker’s stick, not body. Own goals can be scored if the ball comes off a defender’s stick or body. Goals may be scored from anywhere on the pitch and the shooter’s stick is allowed to make contact with the goal. Shooting through players must be penalised – major foul (consider if a yellow card should also be given. Dangerous propelling is an automatic yellow card).</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 14 Out of Bounds (Boundaries)</h2>
                           <p>Teams will play rebounds wherever possible. When the ball does go out of bounds or becomes trapped, the umpire will blow the whistle to stop play and players must stand. Except in the case of a shot or deflected shot on goal, when a player ‘in possession of the ball’ carries, propels, or is the last to touch a ball before it goes out of bounds, the opponents will be awarded the ball when play resumes.</p>
                        
                            <p>Depending on the venue, there may not actually be any boundaries to officiate, and all rebounds will be played without stoppage.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">                   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 15 Throw</h2>
                            <p>A throw is taken when two players are equidistant from a boundary or if a simultaneous foul occurs. Players must be at least 1m inside the boundary and 1m apart. For a simultaneous foul inside the playing area, players must face the centre of the area. .</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">                   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 17 Goal Circle Rules & Penalties</h2>
                            <p>There is no goal circle. If the ball gets trapped in the base of the goal, the umpire will stop play and award the ball to the player who was nearest the ball at the point that play is stopped. If players are equidistant, a throw will be taken at least 5m from the goal to the side of the goal (i.e. not in front of goal).</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">                   
                        <h2> FIL RULE 18 Restraining Line Rules & Penalties</h2>
                            <p>There is no offside.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">
                        <h2> FIL RULE 19 Minor Fouls Rules & Penalties</h2>
                            <p>All free positions must be set up no closer than 5m of the goal. All players must be at least 3m from the player with the ball. The offending player will be placed 3m away from the player with the ball, in the direction that the offending player approached from.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">
                        <h2> FIL RULE 20 Major Fouls Rules & Penalties</h2>
                            <p>There is no 11m or 15m area, however a defender, who is not actively marking an opponent, must not guard the area to the front and sides of the goal, thus making a safe shot impossible i.e. the concept of shooting space still applies. This must be tightly officiated and, if in doubt, err on the side of safety.</p>
                            <p>All free positions must be set up no closer than 5m of the goal. All players must be at least 3m from the player with the ball. The offending player will be placed 3m behind the player with the ball.</p>
                        <hr class="block-divider">
                        <h2> FIL RULE 21 Advantage Flag</h2>
                            <p>There is no advantage flag. Advantage will be indicated using the directional arm signal and saying “advantage” (there is no need to state the colour of the team that is being given the advantage, as the arm signal is sufficient).</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Use a short, sharp whistle for start and end of the game, a longer whistle indicates a goal.</li>
                            <li>Where necessary, give a clear, short explanation of the foul committed, indicating with your arm the team being given possession by pointing towards the goal that they are attacking.</li>
                            <li>Throughout play the umpire’s discretion will be used to award penalties for dangerous play or unacceptable behaviour - a player may be sent off as a last resort.</li>
                            <li>The rules are there to protect players and keep play flowing - unintentional fouls that do not give the offender or their team an advantage should result in a held whistle.</li>
                            <li>Be very aware of players in the shooting space and officiate this very tightly to keep play safe.</li>
                            <li>Players can throw the ball off the wall and get the rebound. In the same way that players can flick a ball when trying to pick it up – this is not necessarily dangerous, but only becomes so when the ball is propelled at or near a player. As umpires we need to determine if the rebound off the wall was dangerously or skillfully executed. If someone throws it hard against the wall and folk are ducking or, worse, hit by the ball – this is clearly dangerous propelling and must be carded. Innovative play is great, unsafe play is not. </li>      
                            <li>If the venue has any markings to help us to determine a distance of 5m from goal, then we should use it as a visual aid, otherwise we need to make a good guess – similar to what we do outdoors when determining 4m from the ball.  </li>
                        </ol>
